Use this sketch to add sensor to gateways whitelist :
- gw side :
  - generates AES 256 bit key
  - generates AES IV (8 bit)
  - gets NodeID from sensor through I2C
  - stores IV into EEPROM
  - Add node to whitelist on SD card (file may be edited manually, though not encouraged)
  - sends AES key and IV through I2C to node
  
- node side :
  - sends NodeID to gw through I2C
  - receives AES key & IV from gw
  - stores it into EEPROM
